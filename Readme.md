readMe file for the java FXML project on actors and movies in second year Bsc Hons Entertainment Systems

This project was to show competency in both Java and JavaFx/FXML, and also how to work in a team.

It uses the MVC System to control the storage of files and had both a command line

IODriver main class(Initially for testing) and a Gui version for the finished project

There is a hardcoded version of the data that crudely creates test data for testing 

and also an xml stream system that can read in the data from XML files and also export the data for persistence.

This was really fun to make.
